# Garden bulletin

_As of 2026-06-29T17:21:16Z_

## Latest

Most of the recent motion is garden self-healing: a batch of library-services jobs landed making the section-index, topics-count, and source-drift scans skip cleanly when the tip has no library or source index (committed as [`3a17c87df`](https://github.com/kriskowal/garden/commit/3a17c87df)), and two pieces of deadmail were swept up — all noop-confirmed completions with no application-code change. The one fresh item on the board is [`improve-clone-keeper-bootstrap-missing-bare-clone`](https://github.com/kriskowal/garden/blob/journal2/jobs/todo/improve-clone-keeper-bootstrap-missing-bare-clone.md), proposing to harden `clone-keeper.sh` against a missing tracked bare clone; it's posted to todo and unclaimed. The two oldest parked PRs ([dapp-stake-control#54](https://github.com/agoric-labs/dapp-stake-control/pull/54) and [#55](https://github.com/agoric-labs/dapp-stake-control/pull/55)) continue to wait on kriskowal at 383 days.
